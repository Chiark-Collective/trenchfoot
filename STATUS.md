# Trenchfoot Status Report — October 30, 2025

## Overview
`trenchfoot` remains focused on surface + volumetric trench meshes. Point-cloud tooling stays retired, and the mesher stack now exposes hooks (and safer default clearances) that make failure analysis and CI hardening less painful.

## Recent Work
- **Mesher debug + adaptive clearance guardrails:** `packages/trenchfoot/gmsh_sloped_trench_mesher.build_trench_volume_from_spec` still exposes `debug_export`, `debug_callback`, and `finalize`, and now scales the guard band with pipe radius + wall slope (baseline 50 mm) plus an optional per-pipe `clearance_scale`. Per-pipe margins are recorded, warnings emit when headroom drops below half the requested clearance, and we fail fast before Gmsh hits PLC errors.
- **Per-pipe metrics + color-coded gallery:** Scenario summaries now include `pipe_clearances` (and the JSON SUMMARY mirrors it). The preview renderer now color-codes trench surfaces vs embedded objects, and the new CLI flag (`--gallery path.md`) writes a Markdown table of those renders; `docs/scenario_gallery.md` and the README gallery come from `uv run python -m trenchfoot.generate_scenarios --preview --skip-volumetric --gallery docs/scenario_gallery.md --include-prebuilt`.
- **Plotly HTML visualisations:** Added `packages/trenchfoot/plot_mesh.py` and the `trenchfoot-plot` entry point (requires the `[viz]` extra) to export interactive Plotly meshes and optionally open them in a browser.
- **Broader scenario coverage:** Added S05 (`wide_slope_pair`) and S06 (`bumpy_wide_loop`) presets with wider trenches, gentler depths, and sloped/bumpy ground. Previews/metrics are checked in alongside the existing S01–S04 set.
- **Physical groups + preview hygiene:** `tests/test_trenchfoot_generation.py` now covers all presets volumetrically, asserts the physical groups, checks the env override, validates the new clearance metrics, and exercises the gallery helpers. Running `uv run python -m trenchfoot.generate_scenarios --volumetric --lc 0.4` regenerates S01–S04 with refreshed previews (matplotlib installed) and clean volumetric meshes.
- **Scenario CLI hygiene:** `TRENCHFOOT_SCENARIO_OUT_ROOT`, `--scratch`, and `--include-prebuilt` give us controlled outputs for CI/test runs so we no longer rewrite the committed fixtures unintentionally.
- **SDK + namespace cleanup:** The top-level `trenchfoot` package now exports `generate_surface_mesh` / `generate_trench_volume`, plus `SurfaceMeshResult` helpers for persisting OBJ/metrics. CLI helpers call the same code, packaging installs under the `trenchfoot` namespace, and fresh tests cover the in-memory path.

## Investigation Notes — S04 PLC Failure (resolved)
- Using `build_trench_volume_from_spec(..., debug_export='S04_debug', debug_callback=...)` showed gmsh producing **seven** post-fragment volumes, with two razor-thin slivers hugging the outer U-bend where the 45° and −60° pipes nearly touched the wall (~15–20 mm gap).
- Bumping the mesher’s pipe clearance constant to 50 mm prevents the boolean from generating those slivers; the resulting mesh now reports four 3‑D physical groups (`TrenchAir`, `Pipe0–Pipe2`) and `gmsh.model.mesh.generate(3)` completes without PLC warnings.

## Testing Snapshot
- `uv run pytest -rs` — green; suite now includes a smoke run over all default presets (surfaces + volumetric) and a CLI env-variable check in addition to the earlier minimal + volumetric coverage.
- `uv run python -m trenchfoot.generate_scenarios --no-preview --volumetric --lc 0.4` — all four presets succeed; `packages/trenchfoot/scenarios/S04_U_slope_multi_noise/volumetric/trench_volume.msh` now contains 4 physical groups (Trench + three pipes).

## Outstanding Issues
- **Heuristic tuning:** The adaptive clearance formula is intentionally conservative; future presets with very tight bends may benefit from spec-level overrides or per-pipe parameters so we can balance safety vs. pipe length.
- **Surface-side copies:** The CLI still overwrites the checked-in `packages/trenchfoot/scenarios/*` when run without a custom `--out`. The env override helps, but we should decide whether to ship fixtures from a separate directory/package.

## Next Steps
1. Consider richer gallery output (e.g., HTML grid or combined montage) for docs sites while keeping the Markdown generator for quick reviews.
2. Allow per-pipe clearance overrides to specify absolute distances (not just scale factors) so scripted pipelines can guarantee minimum gaps regardless of radius.
3. Decide whether to ship the bundled scenarios from a read-only templates directory and direct the CLI to copy into `packages/trenchfoot/scenarios` only when explicitly requested (reduces churn for users browsing the repo).
4. Add smoke coverage for the Plotly CLI (render to a temp HTML without opening a browser) now that the SDK surface is covered.
